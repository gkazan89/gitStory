once upon a time there was a man named bill. 

Bill was hungry, so he went to go get some food at Panda Express.

Panda Express was across the street, so Bill looked both ways

No cars were coming, so Bill crossed the street. 

Unfortunately, Bill got hit by a car traveling at 100mph!

Lucky for Bill, the park nearby was celebrating international trampoline day.

Bill bounced off the trampoline, and was ok. 

He figured a near-death experience was the perfect opportunity to try one of the premium entrees.

Bill treated himself to some fried shrimp and lo mein!

The end.
